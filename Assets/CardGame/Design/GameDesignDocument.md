# Lich Lord: Card & Dice Combat — Game Design Document

## Overview

A turn-based card game with poker-dice mechanics. The player builds a deck of action cards and fights enemies through a series of combat encounters. Each round, both the player and the enemy roll pools of six-sided dice. Cards are played to spend those dice results on damage, defense, and dice manipulation.

## Core Concepts

### Dice
- **Player dice pool**: 5 six-sided dice (d6), rolled at the start of every round.
- **Enemy dice pool**: 2–5 six-sided dice, defined per enemy and rolled at the start of every round.
- Dice results are evaluated using **poker-dice style** rules: singles, pairs, triples, straights, full houses, four-of-a-kind, and five-of-a-kind (Yahtzee).

### Poker-Dice Hand Reference
| Hand | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Single Value | Count dice showing a specific face | Three [4]s showing |
| Pair | Exactly two dice share a value | 3, 3 |
| Two Pair | Two separate pairs | 2, 2, 5, 5 |
| Triple | Exactly three dice share a value | 6, 6, 6 |
| Straight | Five sequential values | 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6 |
| Full House | One triple + one pair | 4, 4, 4, 2, 2 |
| Four of a Kind | Exactly four dice share a value | 1, 1, 1, 1 |
| Five of a Kind | All dice show the same value | 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 |

### Energy
- The player has a **maximum energy** value (default: 3) that resets at the start of every round.
- Each card has an **energy cost** (0–3). Cards can only be played if the player has enough current energy.
- Playing a card reduces current energy by its cost. Energy does not carry between rounds.

### Cards
- The player builds a **deck** before combat.
- At the start of each round, the player **draws 5 cards** from their deck.
- Cards can be played freely in any order during the player's turn, up to the energy limit.
- Unplayed cards are **discarded** at end of round.
- If the draw pile is empty, the discard pile is **shuffled** back into it.

#### Card Duration
- **Instant**: Effect fires once when played, card goes to discard.
- **Persistent**: Effect was applied once when played (e.g., add a die) AND recurring effects (block, reroll) apply again at the start of each subsequent round. Persistent cards remain in play for the rest of combat.

#### Card Targets
Cards specify which dice pool their effects evaluate:
- **Player Dice**: Read your own dice.
- **Enemy Dice**: Read the enemy's dice.

## Turn Structure

### 1. Roll Phase
Both the player and the enemy roll all their dice simultaneously.

### 2. Persistent Effect Phase
Any persistent cards already in play apply their recurring effects:
- Block cards grant block based on the current dice roll.
- Persistent enemy-reroll cards force the enemy to re-roll one or more dice.
- The new enemy dice are used for the rest of the round.

### 3. Player Turn
The player may play any number of cards from their hand as long as they can afford the energy cost.

Card effects resolve immediately in play order:
- Rerolling dice changes the dice pool for subsequent card evaluations.
- Damage dealt reduces the enemy's health immediately.
- Block gained reduces incoming damage from the enemy this round.

The player ends their turn when they choose to pass or run out of playable cards.

### 4. Enemy Turn
Enemy passive effects are evaluated against the enemy's current dice pool.
All enemy damage is totaled, then reduced by any remaining player block.
Excess damage is applied to the player's health.

### 5. End of Round
- Player block is cleared (only persistent block cards restore it next round).
- The player's hand is discarded.
- A new round begins (Step 1).

## Player Rules
- **Starting Health**: 30 HP.
- **Starting Energy**: 3 per round (can be modified by deck/items).
- **Starting Dice Pool**: 5 d6.
- The player wins when the enemy's health reaches 0.
- The player loses when their own health reaches 0.

---

## Enemy Rules
- Enemies do **not** have cards or a hand.
- Each enemy has a set of **passive effects** defined at creation that fire every round automatically.
- Passive effects are evaluated against the **enemy's own dice roll**, not the player's.
- Enemies have **fixed dice counts** (2–5 dice), defined per enemy.
- Some enemies have **pre-round effects** that modify their own dice before the player's turn (e.g., rerolling unfavorable faces).
